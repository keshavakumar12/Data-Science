# Topsis-keshava-102303982

This package provides an implementation of the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method.  
It allows users to rank alternatives based on multiple criteria using a command-line interface.

## What is TOPSIS?

TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique that ranks alternatives based on their distance from:

- an **ideal best solution**
- an **ideal worst solution**

The alternative closest to the ideal best and farthest from the ideal worst gets the highest rank.
